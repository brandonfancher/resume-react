[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a9206c3f-5e23-4860-802f-1540e0efcfef/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/brandonfancher/deploys)

## Purpose

`resume-react` and brandonfancher.com is a quick side project in React. It's a simple, single-page application. Some could argue that it's so straightforward it'd be better implemented as plain HTML and CSS. That's probably true. But this is more of a playground for me, and I can take it in any direction I'd like. That's the point.

For example, I'd love to try out Next.js. When I come up for air, I can take what I've implemented here in React and easily port it over to Next.js.
